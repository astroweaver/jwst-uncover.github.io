Updated UNCOVER+MegaScience Stellar Population catalogs (based on the 
most recent DR3 UNCOVER+MegaScience photometric catalogs) are now available! 

This release uses the same methodology of [Wang et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231001276W/abstract) used in the DR2 SPS catalogs. 

Note this also includes the improved and updated strong lensing model of Abell 2744 (v2.0)! 

See the [Data Release 4 page](/DR4.html#SPSCatalogs) and the SPS modeling paper ([Wang et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231001276W/abstract)) for full details!
