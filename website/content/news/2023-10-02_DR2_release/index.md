New DR2 photometric (presented in [Weaver et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230102671W/abstract)) and SPS catalogs (presented in [Wang et al. 2023](#)) are available! 

These are based on UNCOVER + GLASS + DDT-2767 (PI Chen) NIRCam observations over the extended Abell 2744 cluster footprint, along with all existing HST imaging. 

See the [Data Release 2 page](/DR2.html) and the catalog papers ([Weaver et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230102671W/abstract), [Wang et al. 2023](#)) for full details!
