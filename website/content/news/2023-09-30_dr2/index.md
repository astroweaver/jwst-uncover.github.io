Updated mosaics from the full Abell 2744 NIRCam primary coverage and the 
NIRISS parallel observations are [now available](/DR2.html#Mosaics)! 

Improved DR2 photometric catalogs based on the NIRCam mosaics are also available. 
See the [Data Release 2 page](/DR2.html#PhotometricCatalogs) for the catalogs and further details, as well as the resubmitted version of [Weaver et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230102671W/abstract').
