The UNCOVER survey is a Cycle 1 Treasury program targeting the Abell 2744 lensing cluster. Early NIRCam/NIRISS imaging mosaics were taken and disseminated to the community in late 2022 ([Bezanson et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04026.pdf)) and the team is currently finalizing targets and MSA designs for ultradeep (2.7 - 19 hours) spectroscopic follow-up with the NIRSpec/PRISM (in late July 2023, targets finalized in June 2023). Although we **CANNOT guarantee that any target will be observed, we would like to provide the community with an opportunity to suggest exciting targets! Please feel free to fill out [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrqrsplG3VAc24Dbwp47z7Nf4S-RvuI3ruCUlNzIfvugAgqw/viewform) with as much information as possible and we'll reach out.
