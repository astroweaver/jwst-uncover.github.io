The UNCOVER survey is putting out a public call for potentially interesting objects to observe for our ultradeep (2.7 - 19 hours) spectroscopic follow-up with the NIRSpec/PRISM (in late July 2023, targets finalized in June 2023). Although we **cannot** guarantee that any target will be observed, we would like to provide the community with an *opportunity* to suggest exciting targets! Please feel free to fill out [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrqrsplG3VAc24Dbwp47z7Nf4S-RvuI3ruCUlNzIfvugAgqw/viewform) with as much information as possible and we'll reach out.
