The first UNCOVER spectroscopic release is now available, as presented in 
[Price et al. 2024](URL)!

This release includes spectra of 553 objects from z~0.3 to z~13 
taken in July/Aug 2023 and a spectroscopic redshift catalog. 
(Initial observations of Mask 1 were impacted by a detector short.)

DR4 also includes an improved and updated strong lensing model of Abell 2744 (v2.0), 
and a catalog with new object magnification values! 
<!-- as well as an updated [UNCOVER](/)+[MegaScience](/megascience/) photometric catalog with new object magnification values.  -->

See the [Data Release 4 page](/DR4.html) and the spectroscopic release paper ([Price et al. 2024](URL)) for full details!
