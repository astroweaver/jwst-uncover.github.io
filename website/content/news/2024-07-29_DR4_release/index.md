The initial UNCOVER spectroscopic release is now available, as presented in 
[Price et al. 2024]()!

This release includes spectra of 553 objects from z~0.3 to z~13 
taken in July/Aug 2023 and a spectroscopic redshift catalog. 
(Repeat observations are scheduled 
for Mask 1, which was impacted by a detector short.)

DR4 also includes an improved and updated strong lensing model of Abell 2744 (v2.0), as well as an updated [UNCOVER](/)+[MegaScience](/megascience/) photometric catalog with new object magnification values. 

See the [Data Release 4 page](/DR4.html) and the catalog paper ([Price et al. 2024](URL)) for full details!
