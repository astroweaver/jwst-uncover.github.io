The UNCOVER team made a strong presence at the MIT First Light Conference, showcasing their research through dedicated talks and poster presentations.

UNCOVER PI Ivo Labb√© delivered a compelling talk, discussing his recent paper on red active galactic nuclei discovered in the UNCOVER field. Likewise, Kate Whitaker engaged the community by presenting a poster that featured the UNCOVER field, encouraging attendees to identify intriguing objects within it.

The conference also provided an opportunity for early career researchers within the UNCOVER team to showcase their work. John Weaver presented a poster on our catalog creation, Gourav Khullar shared his findings on the search for quiescent galaxies in the field, Sam Cutler focused on UNCOVER point spread functions, and Richard Pan presented his research on quiescent galaxy stellar mass functions. These contributions reflected their dedicated involvement with UNCOVER.

Additionally, various other UNCOVER members presented their research findings and projects from other collaborations in dedicated talks. Notable mentions include Dan Coe, Seiji Fujimoto, Karl Glazebrook, Anna de Graaff, Michael Maseda, Pascal Oesch, and Christina Williams.
