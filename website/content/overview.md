[UNCOVER official program info](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information.html?id=2561)


UNCOVER is a JWST Cycle 1 public Treasury survey that will obtain deep NIRCam multiband imaging and ultradeep low-resolution NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy of the Frontier Field Abell 2744.


Thanks to the strong lensing boost and the deep observations, UNCOVER will be uniquely positioned to address two core JWST science goals: identifying first-light galaxies at z>10, and characterizing the ultra-low luminosity galaxies that drive reionization at z\~6-7. Other science enabled by UNCOVER include stellar mass complete studies to z\~10; probing the role of dust at high redshift; and the various pathways of quenching star formation out to early times.
